<p> Story: Deemo is a mystic character lives in solitude, a castle, all by itself.
A little girl falls from the sky, not knowing who she is, where she comes from.
To help the little girl back to her world, Deemo comes to realize a tree keeps
growing tall on top of the piano whenever it plays. What would Deemo do when it
gets comfortable with the companionship it never had before? What if the little
girl couldn't deal with the truth when her seemingly lost memories regained?! </p>
